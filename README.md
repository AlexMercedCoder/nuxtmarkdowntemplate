# markdown-blog template by Alex Merced

- The Header and Footer Components determine the theme of the page
- markdowns go in the markdown folder
- src/mark/index determines how the markdowns are listed at "/mark"
- each markdown is visible at at "/mark/filename"
- Prettier and ESLint are enabled so having an autoformatter turned on will make life easier

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
